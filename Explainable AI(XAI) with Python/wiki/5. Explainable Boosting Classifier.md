## Explainable Boosting Classifier

- Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is a tree-based model.
- EBMs are often as accurate as state-of-the-art blackbox model while remaining interpretable.

- Let's start with the foundation that makes EBM explainable
- EBM is a type of Generalized additive model (GAM)
- A GAM  is any model that satisfies this formula
$$
g(E(Y)) = \beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + ... + f_n(x_n)
$$

- The function `f` are named shape functions. The function `g` is the link function.

- This is very similar to linear regression:

$$ 
E(Y) = \Beta_0x_0 + \Beta_1x_1 + \Beta_2x_2 + ... + \Beta_nx_n
$$

- It i cyclic gradient boosting Generalized Additive Model with automatic interaction detection.
- EBMs can be effeicient as random forest (black box model) while begin as explainable as logistic regression.
- Although EBMs are often slower to train than other modern algorithmsm EBMs are extreamly compct and fast at prediction time.

- The times when one had to choose between accuracy and explainablity are over. EBMs can be as efficient as boosted trees while begin as explainable as logistic regression.
- They use boosted trees encoded in a way that allows simple inference and explainations.
- EBMs are part of the `InterpretML` project from Microsoft.
