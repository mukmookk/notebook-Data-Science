![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-icon-labeled.png)

- Conataining popular models
- `VGG-Face`, `Google FaceNet`, `OpenFace`, `Meta DeepFace`, `DeepID`, `ArcFace and Dlib`

- With popular face detectors:
- `opencv`, `ssd`, `dlib`, `mtcnn`, `retinaface`

- Along with popular face recognition metrics:
- `cosine`, `euclidean`, `euclidean_l2`

- Face attribute anlysis module including age, gender, face expression and race

## Face Recognition: Popular Metrics

- Most popular metrics to understand how similiar two vectors are:
</br>
- **Cosine Similiarity**:
  - A measure of similiarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space.
  - It is defined to equal the cosine of the angle between them.
  - It will return `0` if two vectors are similiar.
</br>
- **Euclidean distance**:
  - To calculate the dissimiarity of two vectors
  - It will return 0 if two vectors are similiar.

## Installation
`pip install deepface`
