# Random State

- Setting `random_state` to a fixed value will guarantee that same sequence of random numbers is generated each time you run the code. This helps in verifying the output.

Actually, here we are specifying the seed number for random number generation. When we fix the seed number, then it will always generate same sequence of random numbers but when it is fixed then every time it will generate different sequence of random numbers when we re-run the code.

So, it means if `random_state=integer_value` then when we re-run the code same number of rows will be selected randomly for train and test data, but we specify it as None then every re-run of code will return different set of rows and columns and will pose difficulties in testing our results.

It is important to note that `random_state = 1` or `random_sate=2 or 3` will return the same behaviro as these are just the seed number which we have fixed for generation of random numbers and evetn re-run will return same sequence as this seed number is fixed.
